{"token": ["Emerging evidence that Mexico's economy was back on the recovery track sent Mexican markets into a buzz of excitement Tuesday, with stocks closing at record highs and interest rates at 19-month lows.\"Mexico has been trying to stage a recovery since the beginning of this year and it's always been getting ahead of itself in terms of fundamentals,\" said Matthew Hickman of Lehman Brothers in New York.\"Now we're at the point where the fundamentals are with us. The history is now falling out of view.\"That history is one etched into the minds of all investors in Mexico: an economy in crisis since December 1994, a free-falling peso and stubbornly high interest rates.This week, however, second-quarter gross domestic product was reported up 7.2 percent, much stronger than most analysts had expected. Interest rates on governent Treasury bills, or Cetes, in the secondary market fell on Tuesday to 23.90 percent, their lowest level since Jan. 25, 1995.The stock market's main price index rallied 77.12 points, or 2.32 percent, to a record 3,401.79 points, with volume at a frenzied 159.89 million shares.Confounding all expectations has been the strength of the peso, which ended higher in its longer-term contracts on Tuesday despite the secondary Cetes drop and expectations of lower benchmark rates in Tuesday's weekly auction.With U.S. long-term interest rates expected to remain steady after the Federal Reserve refrained from raising short-term rates on Tuesday, the attraction of Mexico, analysts say, is that it offers robust returns for foreigners and growing confidence that they will not fall victim to a crumbling peso.\"The focus is back on Mexican fundamentals,\" said Lars Schonander, head of researcher at Santander in Mexico City. \"You have a continuing decline in inflation, a stronger-than-expected GDP growth figure and the lack of any upward move in U.S. rates.\"Other factors were also at play, said Felix Boni, head of research at James Capel in Mexico City, such as positive technicals and economic uncertainty in Argentina, which has put it and neighbouring Brazil's markets at risk.\"There's a movement out of South American markets into Mexico,\" he said. But Boni was also wary of what he said could be \"a lot of hype.\"The economic recovery was still export-led, and evidence was patchy that the domestic consumer was back with a vengeance. Also, corporate earnings need to grow strongly to justify the run-up in the stock market, he said."], "label": ["E11", "ECAT", "M11", "M12", "MCAT"], "topic": [], "keyword": []}
{"token": ["Chrysler Corp. Tuesday announced $380 million in new investments for South America, including assembly plants for pickup trucks and diesel engines in Brazil and the expansion of a Jeep plant now being built in Argentina.Chrysler, which is cautiously trying to rebuild its international presence, said the projects in Brazil were worth about $315 million, and the expansion in Argentina was worth about $65 million.Roughly one third of the total investment, or about $126.6 million, will come from Chrysler's suppliers, who will play a major role in the automaker's low-risk global growth strategy, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said.\"We don't intend to make risky investments just to be a major player in emerging markets,\" added Thomas Gale, Chrysler's executive vice president of international operations. \"We're quite content to grow at a steady pace in regions where we see solid opportunities.\"Eaton said the investments will boost Chrysler's sales in the Mercosur free-trade zone, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.But the company's limited production capacity will allow it only to grab a small portion of the Mercosur market away from rivals General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, he said.\"We are targeting very specific market segments,\" he said. \"We don't have any interest or desire to offer a vehicle for every possible application.\"The new Brazilian plant, which will be Chrysler's third limited-production facility in South America, will assemble the automaker's all-new Dakota compact pickup truck for sale in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the countries in the Mercosur free-trade zone.In Argentina, Chrysler said it will add production of about 6,000 Jeep Cherokees a year at a plant now under construction in the Cordoba province. The plant is already scheduled to build about 14,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees per year starting next April, and Cherokee output will begin in 1998.A site for the Brazilian plant will be selected by year-end and vehicles will roll off the assembly line starting in mid-1998, Chrysler said. Production, however, will be modest, with 12,000 trucks in the first year and an ultimate capacity of 40,000 units annually. Employment will start at 400 people.The trucks at first will be largely assembled from \"complete knock-down\" kits shipped from the United States, but the automaker intends to meet the Mercosur trade bloc's 60 percent local content requirement after three years.Chrysler has not decided whether to market the Dakota under the Dodge brand name or under one of its other brands. The automaker now uses the only Jeep and Chrysler brand names outside the United States, Canada and Mexico.The $315 million Brazil investment also includes a new diesel engine plant to be built by Detroit Diesel Corp..The $10 million facility will supply the company's Italian-designed VM Motori four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines for use in the Brazilian Dakota as well as in Jeep models built in Argentina. Chrysler installs about 40,000 of the engines annually into minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold in Europe.Others suppliers supporting the Chrysler by opening plants in Latin America include Dana Corp., Johnson Controls Inc., Lear Corp., Lear Corp. United Technologies Corp. and PPG Industries Inc., Chrysler executives said.Eaton said total annual vehicle sales in the four-country Mercosur region will increase from about 2 million units currently to about 2.5 million by the end of the decade.\"We think this is a major growth area,\" Eaton said. \"It's politically and economically a stable region, we think with particularly rising consumer buying power.\"Including a small plant in Venezuela that assembles Cherokees and Neon small cars from kits, the investments announced Tuesday bring to $735 million the total financial commitments Chrysler and its suppliers have made in South America, the company said.Chrysler stock rose 25 cents to close at $28.875 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange."], "label": ["C24", "CCAT"], "topic": [], "keyword": []}
{"token": ["CompuServe Corp. Tuesday reported a surprisingly large $29.6 million fiscal first-quarter loss, blaming a decline in the number of subscribers to the No. 2 online service and spending on a new family-oriented service and improvements.CompuServe predicted a second-quarter loss but said earnings would improve in the second half of the fiscal year.\"We are taking steps to revitalise CompuServe,\" said Chief Executive Bob Massey.The company said it would cut 150 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force, as part of a cost-cutting programme expected to save $30 million on an annualized basis.The Columbus, Ohio-based company said that as part of the cost cuts it would sell its Spry Inc. unit, whose Web browser trails far behind similar products made by Netscape Communications Corp. and Microsoft Corp.The loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, in the company's fiscal 1997 first quarter ended July 31 compared with last year's quarterly profit of $26.8 million, or 36 cents a share. The results included a pretax charge of $17.7 million, or 13 cents per share.CompuServe last month said it expected to post a loss for the quarter, but the actual loss was greater than Wall Street expectations.The company reported revenues of $208.6 million for the quarter vs. $186.5 million in the previous year's quarter.Massey, expanding on last month's comments, said the number of people cancelling their subscriptions exceeded the 900,000 new subscribers to the company's online services, producing a \"modest decline\" in subscriber numbers.As of July 31, the company's flagship CompuServe Information Service had 3.3 million members worldwide, the company said. Total subscribers, including members of NiftyServe, a joint-venture Japanese online service, numbered 5.2 million.CompuServe, founded in 1969, is second only to America Online Inc., with 6.2 million subscribers.CompuServe also blamed the loss on investments in its family-oriented WOW! service and infrastructure improvements.It said it expected losses to continue into the second fiscal quarter, hitting 10 cents to 15 cents a share, due to the costs of rolling out the latest version of the software needed to access the service, Compuserve 3.0, and the release of a feature that makes WOW! look different to teenagers than it does to their parents.But the forecast for the second half of its fiscal year was rosier.\"Coupled with new product releases and aggressive marketing campaigns, we expect the third and fourth quarters to improve with subscribers topping the 7-million mark, including our Japanese licensee service, NiftyServe,\" Massey said in a statement.The company said it also expected increased revenue from advertising and fees for electronic commerce.CompuServe is a former subsidiary of tax preparer H&R Block Inc., which spun off the company and is selling its 80 percent stake in CompuServe.CompuServe announced its financial results after markets closed. Its stock dropped 12.5 cents to $13.50 on Nasdaq in earlier trading."], "label": ["C151", "C15", "CCAT", "E41", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GJOB"], "topic": [], "keyword": []}
